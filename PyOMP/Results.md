# Result Summary

We now go over the results as described in the paper.

The authors claim that the key result of their work is that PyOMP works. They have achieved reasonable speedups (i.e., achieving performance similar to C programs) for the three design patterns commonly used in OpenMP programming (Single Program Multiple Data, Loop Level Parallelism, and Divide and Conquer). For more information on these design patterns, see [OpenMP Design Patterns](../OpenMP/OpenMPDesignPatterns.md).

The original results can be found in the paper available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353635635_Multithreaded_parallel_Python_through_OpenMP_support_in_Numba).
